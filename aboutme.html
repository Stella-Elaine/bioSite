            Sam Hancock , 
            29, Network Engineer: Cloud Infrastructure, Rock Climber, Vegetarian. 
            Born in Al, moved to Washington DC. <br>
            Pet lover, Part time gig on Rover.<br>
             By day, Sam works as a network engineer. <br>
             His analytical mindset and problem-solving abilities have accelerated his career trajectory, 
             earning him recognition over the last seven years from a Security Analyst to his current role in the Network team!   <br>
             Beyond his professional life, Sam is an avid rock climber who can often be found at the Bouldering Project in the district. <br> 
             This passion for climbing developed during the pandemic has since become a cornerstone of his identity. <br>
             As a committed vegetarian for the last year Sam approaches nutrition with new attention to detail. <br> Sam unwinds with books on adventure and technology, and enjoys occasional morning jogs along the Potomac Riverâ€”a hobby<br>
            that helps clear his mind before diving into work.</p>
